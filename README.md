# IsbisterEtAl-SciRep2021-Data

This repository contains preprocessed spike sorted data for reproducing all analyses from the paper:  
**Clustering and control for adaptation uncovers time-warped spike time patterns in cortical networks in vivo** (Isbister et al. 2021)

This data was principally collected by:

- Dr. Vicente Reyes-Puerta
- Dr. Jyh-Jang Sun
- Professor Heiko Luhmann

for the following studies:
- Reyes-Puerta, V.et al. Long-range intralaminar noise correlations in the barrel cortex. Journal of neurophysiology 113,3410–3420 (2015)
- Reyes-Puerta, V., Sun, J.-J., Kim, S., Kilb, W. & Luhmann, H. J. Laminar and columnar structure of sensory-evoked multineuronal spike sequences in adult rat barrel cortex in vivo. Cerebral Cortex25,2001–2021 (2014).
- Reyes-Puerta, V. et al. High stimulus-related information in barrel cortex inhibitory interneurons. PLoS computa-tional biology1 1,e1004121 (2015).
